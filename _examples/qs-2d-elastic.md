This example shows that the simulations recovers the discplacement predicted by classical continnums mechanics for a given load in force. The full example is shown in the following publication:

## Generating the mesh

The file [input_mesh.yaml](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/tree/master/examples/qsModel/2D/input_mesh.yaml) in the [example folder](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/tree/master/examples/qsModel/2D) will generate the mesh as shown in the following figure.

</p>

## Model

The quasi-static models as described in [1] is used to assemble the tangent stiffness matrix and obtain the solution by solving Newton steps.

```yaml
Model: 
  Dimension: 2 
  Discretization_Type:
    Spatial: finite_difference
    Time: quasi_static
  Final_Time: 1 
  Time_Steps: 1
  Horizon: 0.5
  Horizon_h_Ratio: 5
```

### Material model

The state-based elastic material models as described in [2] is implemented for the `ElasticState` material.

```yaml
Material: 
  Type: ElasticState 
  Density: 1200
  Compute_From_Classical: true 
  K: 4000.0 
  G: 1500.0
  Is_Plane_Strain: False
  Influence_Function: 
    Type: 1 
```

### Applying boundary conditions

#### Displacement boundary conditions

The following code applies a fixed displacement to the first layer of nodes on the right-hand side in the first figure in both directions. 

```yaml
Displacement_BC: 
  Sets: 2 
  Set_1:  
    Location:   
      Line: [1.55, 1.65]
    Direction: [1] 
    Time_Function: 
      Type: constant 
      Parameters: 
        - 0.0 
    Spatial_Function: 
      Type: constant 
  Set_2:  
    Location:   
      Line: [1.55, 1.65]
    Direction: [2] 
    Time_Function: 
      Type: constant 
      Parameters: 
        - 0.0 
    Spatial_Function: 
      Type: constant 

```

#### Force boundary conditions

The following code applies a external body force density to the last node on the left-hand side in the first figure.

Note that in this example we want to apply a force $F=-40N$, however, the body force density has the units $\frac{N}{mm^2}$. Thus, 
the force is devided by the area $1.6\times 0.1$, where $1.6$ is the length of the plate and $0.1$ is the mesh width. This results
in a body force density $-250$.

```yaml
Force_BC:
  Sets: 1
  Set_1:
    Location:
      Line: [-0.1, 0.05]
    Direction: [1]
    Time_Function:
      Type: linear
      Parameters:
        - 1
    Spatial_Function:
      Type: constant
      Parameters:
        - -250.0
```

### Solver

```yaml
Solver:
  Type: BiCGSTAB
  Max_Iteration: 200
  Tolerance: 1e-6
  Perturbation: 1e-7
```

## Validation 

The prediction of the displacement field in $x$-direction is shown in second figure. For the derivation of the displacement field, we refer to [3].

The third figure shows the obtained displacement field by the code using the above configuration.
