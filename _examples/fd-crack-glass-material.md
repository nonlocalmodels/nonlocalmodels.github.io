This example shows the setup and configuration of the example shown in the following paper:

* Lipton, R.P., Lehoucq, R.B. & Jha, P.K. Complex Fracture Nucleation and Evolution with Nonlocal Elastodynamics. J Peridyn Nonlocal Model 1, 122â€“130 (2019). [https://doi.org/10.1007/s42102-019-00010-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42102-019-00010-0)

Following steps explain the example and the YAML donfiguration file is available [here](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/blob/main/examples/fdModel/crack_propagation/input.yaml).

- We consider a Peridynamic simulation of Glass material using RNP Peridynamic model (Regularized Nonlinear Peridynamic) developed and studied in [Lipton 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10659-015-9564-z) and [Jha and Lipton 2018](https://doi.org/10.1137/17M1112236). RNP model is implemented in class [RNPBond](../../../src/material/pd/rnpBond.h).

- Units are SI units, e.g. length is in `meter`, mass is in `kg`, force is in `N`, and time is in `second`.

- Elastic properties of material are as follows:

	- Bulk modulus `K = 25.0E+09 Pa`
	- Poisson ratio `$\nu$ = 0.25`
	- Density `$\rho$ = 1200 kg/$m^3$`

- Fracture properties of material are as follows:

	- Critical energy release rate `$G_c$ = 500 J/$m^2$`

- For above elastic properties and fracture properties, we can compute the parameters in Peridynamic material model. This has been described in detail in [RNPBond::computeParameters](../../../src/material/pd/rnpBond.h).

- Material domain is rectangle with length `$L_x$ = 0.1 m` in x-direction and length `$L_y$ = 0.1 m` in y-direction. We use `plane-stress` assumption and take thickness of material to be just `1 m`.

- Horizon is `$\epsilon$ = $L_y$/50` and mesh size is `h = $\epsilon$/4`.

- Time domain

	- Final time `T = 0.00014`
	- Time steps `N = 35000`
	- Output frequency of simulation data: `N/70`

- Boundary condition

	- We fix top layer of thickness, i.e. we apply displacement boundary condition `$u_x$ = 0` and `$u_y$ = 0`.

	- We apply constant velocity (i.e. linear in time displacement) on layers at the bottom edge of domain. The thickness of layer is same as horizon `$\epsilon$`. 

	- Value of constant velocity along x-direction is `v = 1.0 m/s`. 
	
	- Displacement boundary condition is implemented in [ULoading](../../../src/loading/uLoading.h)

	- See <a href="#result">figure</a> for setup details.

- Pre-crack: We consider vertical pre-crack of length `l = 0.02 m` starting from center of bottom edge, see figure above. 

	- Pre-crack and fracture related methods can be found in [Fracture](../../../src/geometry/fracture.h).

- We specify `Displacement`, `Velocity`, `Force` and `Damage_Z` as output candidates. 

The complete YAML configuration file is available [here](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/blob/main/examples/fdModel/crack_propagation/input.yaml).

### Mesh
We consider uniform mesh of mesh size `h = $\epsilon$/4`. 

- To generate uniform mesh, run [Mesh](../../../tools/mesh/mesh.cpp) with input file `input_mesh.yaml`. It will produce `mesh.vtu` which is needed to run the simulation, see `input.yaml` file where mesh input details are provided.

The complete YAML configuration file is available [here](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/blob/main/examples/fdModel/crack_propagation/input_mesh.yaml).


### Results
We show setup, displacement, and damage plot at time `t = 0.000058 seconds`. Results are from paper [Lipton et al 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42102-019-00010-0).
