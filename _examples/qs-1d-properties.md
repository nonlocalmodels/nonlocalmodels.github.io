This example shows that simulations recovers the the strain and stress predicted by classical continnums mechanics for a given load in force. The full example is shown in the following publication:

## Generating the mesh

The file [input_mesh.yaml](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/tree/master/examples/qsModel/1D/input_mesh.yaml) in the [example folder](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/tree/master/examples/qsModel/1D) will generate the mesh as shown in the following figure.

</p>

## Setup the simulation

The file [input.yaml](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/tree/master/examples/qsModel/1D/input.yaml) in the [example folder](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/tree/master/examples/qsModel/1D) contains following code snippets to setup the simulation.

### Model

The quasi-static models as described in [1] is used to assemble the tangent stiffness matrix and obtain the solution by solving Newton steps. 

```yaml 
Model:
  Dimension: 1
  Discretization_Type:
    Spatial: finite_difference
    Time: quasi_static
  Final_Time: 1
  Time_Steps: 1
  Horizon: 1
  Horizon_h_Ratio: 3
Mesh:
  File: mesh.vtu
```

### Material model

The state-based elastic material models as described in [2] is implemented for the `ElasticState` material.

```yaml
Material:
  Type: ElasticState
  Density: 1
  Compute_From_Classical: true
  E: 4000
  Influence_Function:
    Type: 1
```

### Applying boundary conditions

#### Displacement boundary conditions

The following code applies a fixed displacement to the first node on the left-hand side in the first figure. 


```yaml
Displacement_BC:
  Sets: 1
  Set_1:
    Location:
      Line: [-0.1, 0.3]
    Direction: [1]
    Time_Function:
      Type: constant
      Parameters:
        - 0.0
    Spatial_Function:
      Type: constant
```

#### Force boundary conditions

The following code applies a external body force density to the last node on the right-hand side in the first figure.
Note that in this example we want to apply a force $F=40$, however since the last node has a volume $v=0.25$ this results
in a body force density $b=40/0.25=166$.

```yaml
Force_BC:
  Sets: 1
  Set_1:
    Location:
      Line: [15.9, 16.5]
    Direction: [1]
    Time_Function:
      Type: linear
      Parameters:
        - 1
    Spatial_Function:
      Type: constant
      Parameters:
        - 160
```

### Solver

```yaml
Solver:
  Type: ConjugateGradient
  Max_Iteration: 1000
  Tolerance: 1e-9
  Perturbation: 1e-7
```

## Validation

### Forces

<p id="mesh" align="center">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/qs_1D_force.png" alt="setup"  />
</p>

All the forces in the mid of the bar are zero, except the forces at the boundary which are $F=40$ on the right-hand side and $F=-40$ on the left-hand side. This corresponds to the loading we applied.

### Stress

<p id="mesh" align="center">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/qs_1D_force.png" alt="setup"  />
</p>

The stress in classical continuum mechanics is given as $\sigma=F/S$, where $F$ is the applied force and $S$ is the surface area of the bar. Assuming a surface area $S=1$ leads to $\sigma=40/1=40$ which matches the stress in the Figures for the nodes in the center of the bar. Note that the nodes close to the boundary have non-matching values due to the so-called surface effect. 


### Strain

<p id="mesh" align="center">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/qs_1D_strain.png" alt="setup"  />
</p>

The strain in classical continuum mechanics is given as $\epsilon=F/(S\cdot E)=40/(1\cdot 4000)=0.01$ which matches for the nodes in the center of the bar. Note that the nodes close to the boundary have non-matching values due to the so-called surface effect.

### Strain energy

<p id="mesh" align="center">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/qs_1D_strain_energy.png" alt="setup"  />
</p>

The strain energy in classical continuum mechanics is given as $U=\sigma^2/(2\cdot E)=40^2/(2\cdot 4000)=0.2$ which matches for the nodes in the center of the bar. Note that the nodes close to the boundary have non-matching values due to the so-called surface effect.
