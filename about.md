The non local models organization is a collaboration of [researchers](/team) developing a simulation code for various non local models, e.g. [peridynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridynamics). 

The code [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/nonlocalmodels/NLMech.svg)](https://GitHub.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/releases/) is released on [GitHub](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels) using [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalmodels.github.io.svg)](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalmodels.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE). The master branch  has the status [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nonlocalmodels/NLMech.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalheatequation). The code quality of the master branch is [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/118379d7d745464584b73e9e06f60462)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/nonlocalmodels/NLMech?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=nonlocalmodels/NLMech&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) and the test coverage is [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nonlocalmodels/NLMech?branch=master). We have [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/nonlocalmodels/nlmech.svg)](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/NLMech/issues).

The latest documentation is available [here](https://nonlocalmodels.github.io/documentation/).

The code uses the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency ([HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP)) for its parallel and distributed implementation. 

Following packages are available:

* [build tools](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/buildscripts) for an ease installation, and.
* [HPCBuildInfrastructure](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/HPCBuildInfrastructure) for an ease installation of any HPC environment,
